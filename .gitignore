# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp


# Ignore
*.rbc
capybara-*.html
.rspec
/db/*.sqlite3
/public/system
/coverage/
/spec/tmp
**.orig
rerun.txt
pickle-email-*.html

# Comment out these rules if you are OK with uploading secrets to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/secrets.yml

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# Ignore environment variables settings file
# Do NOT commit environment variables to the repository!
.rbenv-vars
